Question 1. Describe the most difficult hurdle you had to overcome in implementing your solution.
        Answer: I wanted to do this challenge using Puppet, and in the process, I learnt basics of how to use Puppet. I would not say it was difficult but it took some time getting used to it, but I truly enjoyed this experience. I like the idea of offering a technical challenge to candidates to prove that they are serious about the job opportunity at your company.

==================================================================

Question 2. Please explain why requirement (d) above is important.
        Answer: Infrastructure as code is the prerequisite for common DevOps practices such as version control, code review, continuous integration and automated testing. If anything changes unexpectedly in the infrastructure, or if infrastructure is not in a desired state, then an automation solution 'agent' running periodically can fix the issue. If all the configurations are repeated by a solution periodically then it would cause unnecessary downtime and wastage of resources.

==================================================================

Question 3. Where did you go to find information to help you?
        Answer: Since I had to learn Puppet for this assignment, I found most of the information on Puppet Forge and Ask Puppet. However, at times I also used Google search for answers and/or examples.

==================================================================

Question 4. Briefly explain what automation means to you, and why it is important to an organization's infrastructure design strategy.
        Answer: In short, Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed without human assistance. Automation is the foundation for many DevOps practices, and if done correctly, it helps you move faster without sacrificing stability or security. Automation helps deliver technology changes faster, more frequently, release better software, and with more confidence.

==================================================================

Extra Credit: 
This technical exercise is your opportunity to demonstrate your abilities in the domain of configuration automation. Delivering a solution which meets the above requirements is sufficient to demonstrate your competency in this area; however, you are free to be creative and provide a solution which goes the extra mile. e.g., using Puppet, etc.
    -- This solution is implemented using Puppet Open Source
